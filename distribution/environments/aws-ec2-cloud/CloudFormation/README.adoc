= CloudFormation template for Jenkins Essentials

CAUTION: Work in progress

TODO/questions:

* Restrict ingress/egress for all services
  (Example: stricter master -> agents connectivity (secu group)?)

** we should not limit egress from agents, to allow say cloning repos etc.
* dedicated VPC for Master + agents ?
*** Two subnets (?)
*** One for internal Master<->agents
*** One to expose Master for WebHooks
* agents have no ingress allowed

* Secrets/Access key passing (docker secrets? Hashicorp Vault? Env var is the easiest but the most insecure?)
