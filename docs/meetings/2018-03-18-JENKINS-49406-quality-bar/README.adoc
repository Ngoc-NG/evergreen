= 2018-03-18 - How to test the data snapshotting system (JENKINS-49406)

We wanted to discuss testing link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-49406[https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-49406] itself, but also possibly the  overall quality bar footnote:[the different quality requirements we make sure to test, generally defining them *before* the software is developed, and met before it goes to production :-)] for Jenkins Essentials.


== Attendees

* Raul Arabaolaza
* Baptiste Mathus

== Notes

RAUL: This is intended for development time, not deployment like
synthetic transactions

Idea is Try an upgrade, test all works properly perform a rollback and
test again all is working

BAPTISTE: We are likely to be able to reuse the “health check” logic
that will have to be developed for evergreen-client itself in
production, to check if Jenkins is running fine.

RAUL: To read and check the jep part related to testing, also to tell
Isa about it

RAUL: critical: we need to test the health check :)

QUESTION: Should we try to implement synthetic transactions as they were
discussed in seville meeting for this or go with ATH which already
exists?

PROPOSALS for Rollback testing:

* Make sure there is enough coverage that all possible rollback paths are covered
** Create a quality bar for rollbacks
*** Make sure you are including some failing scenarios in the quality bar
**** Not only test the happy path, for example:
***** Made a failed upgrade, test that we are able to detect the upgrade as
a failure, rollback and test that the instance is working perfectly
*****  Made a failed upgrade, test that we are able to detect the upgrade as
a failure, made a failed rollback and test that we are able to detect
the rollback failed
***** Make sure that in case of different chained rollback strategies we
test each and every one of them

* Create a healthcheck url to be invoked via CURL for example

** We can create a plugin that provides that healthcheck url and
integrate with ST
** Maybe some work from metrics plugin can be reused

* Some possible testing flows:

** Upgrade run health check (ST), rollback, ST again ¿and ATH?

*** No work yet on ST that I am aware of, but ST can be later reused for
deployment testing

** Run ATH, rollback, ATH again

*** Some work already done, but ATH is maybe too heavy and coverage is
pretty poor and based on individual plugins not in coherent sets of them

* This should be done in the “pre canary, staging, or whatever is named”
instances because we want to catch any possible degradation or problems
in long running instances

SIDE NOTE: Make sure that jenkins is not going to run any job when
upgrading or rolling back to minimize the number of files to worry about
