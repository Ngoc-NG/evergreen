= _Essentials_ Use Cases
:toc:
:sectnums:

This document summarizes the Priority 1 use cases for _Jenkins Essentials_.

NOTE: This is still early work.
To help the thought process, the cases definition and analysis was done by thinking about what a demonstration would need to go through.

== Priority 1 Cases: Risk analysis

=== I can start an instance from scratch and it's available

* Registration & authentication service need to be available:
** An Internet connection is required
** Bandwidth needs to be enough to download things in a _reasonable_ time.
(It can probably be more than 5 minutes, if there is an issue.)
* Binaries repository must be available.

=== Jenkins is constantly upgraded safely

* If the backend becomes unavailable:
** Check the evergreen-client does reconnect automatically when back.
* it the unavailability happens just after a failed upgrade, can we rollback offline?

=== Starting in a given cloud environment, Essentials is auto-configured and ready to build with it

Concrete examples:

* auto-configuring the docker-plugin if the Docker socket is available,
* auto-configuring with ec2-plugin if AWS.

== Priority 2 Cases

=== First startup should be done in less than 5 clicks and 5 minutes
